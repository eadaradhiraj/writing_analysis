Cardiac myxoma in pregnancy: a comprehensive review. by Yuan SM
Cardiac myxoma in pregnancy is rare and the clinical characteristics of this
entity have been insufficiently elucidated. This article aims to describe the
treatment options and the risk factors responsible for the maternal and
feto-neonatal prognoses.

A comprehensive search of the literature of cardiac myxoma in pregnancy was
conducted and 44 articles with 51 patients were included in the present
review.

Transthoracic echocardiography was the most common diagnostic tool for the
diagnosis of cardiac myxoma during pregnancy. Cardiac myxoma resection was
performed in 95.9% (47/49); while no surgical resection was performed in 4.1%
(2/49) patients (P=0.000). More patients had an isolated cardiac
myxoma resection in comparison to those with a concurrent or staged additional
cardiac operation [87.2% (41/47) vs. 12.8% (6/47),
P=0.000]. A voluntary termination of the pregnancy was
done in 7 (13.7%) cases. In the remaining 31 (60.8%) pregnant patients, cesarean
section was the most common delivery mode representing 61.3% and vaginal delivery
was more common accounting for 19.4%. Cardiac surgery was performed in the first,
second and third trimester in 5 (13.9%), 14 (38.9%) and 17 (47.2%) patients,
respectively. No patients died. In the delivery group, 20 (76.9%) neonates were
event-free survivals, 4 (15.4%) were complicated and 2 (7.7%) died. Neonatal
prognoses did not differ between the delivery modes, treatment options, timing of
cardiac surgery and sequence of cardiac myxoma resection in relation to
delivery.

The diagnosis of cardiac myxoma in pregnancy is important. Surgical treatment of
cardiac myxoma in the pregnant patients has brought about favorable maternal and
feto-neonatal outcomes in the delivery group, which might be attributable to the
shorter operation duration and non-emergency nature of the surgical intervention.
Proper timing of cardiac surgery and improved cardiopulmonary bypass conditions
may result in even better maternal and feto-neonatal survivals.

Mixoma cardíaco durante a gravidez é raro e as
características clínicas dessa entidade não foram
suficientemente esclarecidas. Este artigo tem como objetivo descrever as
opções de tratamento e os fatores de risco responsáveis pelo
prognóstico materno e fetal-neonatal.

Foi realizada uma pesquisa abrangente na literatura sobre mixoma cardíaco
durante a gravidez e 44 artigos com 51 pacientes foram incluídos na
presente revisão.

Ecocardiografia transtorácica foi a ferramenta de diagnóstico mais
comum para o diagnóstico de mixoma cardíaco durante a gravidez.
Ressecção do mixoma cardíaco foi realizada em 95,9% (47/49);
enquanto não foi realizada ressecção cirúrgica em 4,1%
(2/49) dos pacientes (P=0,000). Mais pacientes tiveram
ressecção isolada do mixoma cardíaco em
comparação com aqueles com operação cardíaca
concomitante ou adicional [87,2% (41/47) vs. 12,8% (6/47),
P=0,000]. A interrupção voluntária
da gravidez foi feita em 7 (13,7%) casos. Nas restantes 31 (60,8%) pacientes
grávidas, a cesariana foi o modo de parto mais comum, representando 61,3% e
parto vaginal contabilizou 19,4%. A cirurgia cardíaca foi realizada no
primeiro, segundo e terceiro trimestre em 5 (13,9%), 14 (38,9%) e 17 (47,2%)
pacientes, respectivamente. Nenhuma paciente morreu. No grupo de parto, 20 (76,9%)
recém-nascidos sobreviveram livres de eventos, 4 (15,4%) tiveram
complicações e 2 (7,7%) morreram. Os prognósticos neonatais
não diferiram entre os modos de parto, opções de tratamento,
tempo de cirurgia cardíaca e sequência de ressecção
mixoma cardíaco em relação ao parto.

O diagnóstico de mixoma cardíaco durante a gravidez é
importante. Tratamento cirúrgico de mixoma cardíaco em pacientes
grávidas trouxe resultados favoráveis para as mães e os
neonatos no grupo de parto, o que pode ser atribuído à
duração mais curta da operação e à natureza
não emergencial da intervenção cirúrgica. O momento
adequado da cirurgia cardíaca e melhoria das condições de
circulação extracorpórea podem resultar em
sobrevivência materna e do feto-neonato ainda melhor.

Cardiovascular disorders during pregnancy have become a more and more attracting issue
concerning both mother and child in terms of their prognoses[1]. Cardiac surgery during pregnancy
remains a tough problem due to the fact that cardiopulmonary bypass jeopardizes fetuses
more than mothers[2].
The overall feto-neonatal mortality was 18.6% among the pregnant patients with a cardiac
operation[1]. The
fetal deaths were apparently associated with cardiac surgery during early pregnancy as
well as the use of cardiopulmonary bypass[3]. Cardiac myxoma in pregnancy is one of the cardiovascular
disorders that warrant a surgical resection without delay[1]. However, the clinical features
of cardiac myxomas in the pregnant patients have not been sufficiently elaborated, and
the risk factors influencing the maternal and feto-neonatal outcomes remain uncertain.
In order to highlight these aspects, a comprehensive literature review of pregnant
cardiac myxoma is conducted.

Publications in all languages reporting on cardiac myxoma during pregnancy until
November 2014 were retrieved from MEDLINE, Highwire Press, Google and Yahoo! search
engines, Chinese Medical Citation Index (CMCI) and LILACs. The search terms "cardiac
myxoma" and "pregnancy" were searched. In addition, "left atrial", "right atrial", "left
ventricular", "right ventricular", "mitral valve", "tricuspid valve" and "aortic valve"
were also used in the search strategy to find articles containing cardiac myxomas.

Primary exclusion criteria included articles describing cardiac myxoma diagnosed
postpartum, other types of cardiac tumors, undetermined nature of intracardiac mass, or
myxoma of the other organs of the pregnant patients, fetal cardiac myxoma, or cardiac
myxoma of animals. Papers with no complete data of the pregnant patients were excluded
for the statistical analyses. Table 1 shows the
results of literature retrieval. Data were carefully extracted for details of the
patient population, demographics, diagnosis, clinical features of cardiac myxomas,
associated disorders/comorbidities, cardiac surgical procedures, delivery modes, timing
of cardiac myxoma and delivery, follow-up length and survival, complication and
mortality of both mother and baby, etc. This rare condition was only reported in
sporadic single case or small series without larger patient population, comparative, or
randomized studies. Accordingly, the qualitative analysis of the collective data from
the retrieved articles constituted a systematic review, as suggested in the Quality of
Reporting of Meta-Analyses (QUOROM) recommendations[4].

Literature retrieval.

Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard deviation along with range
and median values, and intergroup differences were compared by unpaired t-test.
Comparisons of frequencies were made by Fisher's exact test and
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 47 articles were collected. By excluding 3 duplicate
publications[5-7], 44 articles[2,8-50] involving 51
pregnant patients were taken for statistical analysis. Their ages were
29.5±5.1 (20-40; median, 29) (n=39). Their pregnant history
was not mentioned in 21 (41.2%) patients, while reported in 30 (58.8%) patients with
8 (26.7%) nulliparous, 8 (26.7%) monoparous and 14 (46.7%) multiparous. The timing of
the pregnant patients to be symptomatic was available for 15 (29.4%) patients, with a
mean duration of diseased course of cardiac myxoma of 4.0±7.2 months (28
hours-24 months; median, 1 month) (n=10) (no quantitative timing was
available in 3 patients[11,19,39].

The symptoms of the cardiac myxoma of the pregnant patients were described in 39
(76.5%) patients. Eight (20.5%) patients were asymptomatic[12,16,21,35,41,42,45,48]; while 31
(79.5%) manifested one or two of the Goodwin's triad, namely circulatory, embolic and
constitutional symptoms (Table 2). A cardiac
murmur or an abnormal heart sound was audible in 18 (35.3%) patients with a systolic
murmur [6 (33.3%)][12,15,26,34,35,43] and a diastolic murmur [4
(30.8%)][8,14,33,45] being the
most common one. Twenty-seven (52.9%) patients had one or more comorbidities or
complications of a cardiac myxoma (Table
3).

Associated disorders.

The timing of diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was described in 39 (76.5%) individuals.
Two (5.1%) patients were diagnosed with a cardiac myxoma in the 1st and
23rd months before the current pregnancy, and their gestational ages
were recorded as "-4" and "-92" weeks[2,13]. Among the 37
(94.9%) patients, the cardiac myxoma was diagnosed in the first, second and third
trimesters in 7 (18.9%), 19 (51.4%) and 11 (29.7%) patients, respectively
(χ2=9.1, P=0.011) with a mean
of 21.7±8.4 (range, 6.7-38; median, 22) weeks (n=35).

The diagnostic techniques for the cardiac myxoma were described in 34 (66.7%)
patients, by transthoracic echocardiography in 26 (70%)[2,8-13,17,20,21,24,27-29,33-35,38,40,42,43,45,47,48,50], transthoracic and transesophageal
echocardiography in 4 (13.3%)[15,27,30,32],
transesophageal echocardiography in 2 (6.7%)[36,41],
cardiac catheterization[14] and a battery of tests[46] in 1 (3.3%) patient.

Location of cardiac myxoma was not clearly stated in 5 (9.8%) patients. In the
remaining 46 (90.2%) patients, it was located in the left atrium in 37 (80.4%)
[intraatrial septum in 11 (29.7%)[8-10,26,29,30,40,42,47,48],
anterior mitral leaflet in 2 (5.4%)[2,32], free
wall[36] in 1
(2.7%) and unknown in 23 (62.2%) patients[2,13,14,16-18,23,24,26-28,31,33,34,37-39,44-46,50], right
atrium in 5 (10.9%)[2,11,15,20,36] (one was multiple[20]), left ventricle in 2
(4.3%)[12,21], right ventricle in 1
(2.2%)[43] and
multiple sites (septal tricuspid leaflet, left atrium, intraatrial septum and left
atrial appendage) in 1 (2.2%) patient[41]. Three patients had recurrent cardiac
myxomas[12,35,41] and one of them were recurrent multiple cardiac
myxomas[41]. A
total of 12 atrial myxomas including 11 (29.7%, 11/37) left atrial myxomas and 1
(20%, 1/5) right atrial myxoma[20] prolapsed into the ventricle during diastole.

The attachment of the myxoma was described in 16 (31.4%) patients, it was
pedunculated in 15 (93.8%)[8,9,12-15,20,26,29,30,35,36,40,42,48] and sessile in 1 (6.3%) patient[2]. The dimensions of the cardiac
myxomas were available in 25 (49.0%) patients. One of them was described as
"egg-sized"[46]
and average dimension of the remaining 24 myxomas was 55.1±24.5 (range,
22-130; median, 55) mm (n=24)[2,8,9,11,12-15,20,21,23,26,27,29,30,32,35,39,42,43,47].

The diagnosis of the cardiac myxoma was delayed in 3 (5.9%) patients in the
1st, 3rd and 3rd week after
admission[14,33,49].

Treatment was not given in 2 (3.9%) patients[22]. Concerning the remaining 49 patients,
surgical operation was not performed in 2 (4.1%) patients but with anticoagulant and
antibiotic therapy in one[36] and decline of treatment by another[41]. A surgical resection of
cardiac myxoma was performed in 47 (95.9%) patients including a sole cardiac myxoma
resection in 41 (87.2%)[2,8-21,23-27,29,31-39,43-46,48-50], concurrent mitral valve
repair[40,47] and staged mitral valve
replacement[28,29] in 2 (4.3%), and staged
mitral valve repair[30] and concurrent patent fossa ovalis
closure[42] in
1 (2.1%) patient. Cardiac surgery was performed in the first, second and third
trimester in 5 (13.9%), 14 (38.9%) and 17 (47.2%) patients
(χ2=9.8, P=0.008) at a mean of
25.2±9.4 (range, 9-41; median 27) weeks of gestational age
(n=36); while timing of cardiac surgery was not given in 15 (29.4%)
patients. A cardiac myxoma resection was delayed in 4 (7.8%) patients for a
few[43],
7[21],
15[40] and 690
days[13],
respectively. The feto-neonatal fate was not mentioned in 13 (25.5%)
cases[15,22,24,27,31,37,38,41,44,47]. Voluntary termination of pregnancy was done
in 7 (13.7%) cases with 6 (85.7%) early-mid-termed[2,9,12,23,42] and 1
(14.3%) late pregnancy termination[50] with mean gestational age of 17.0±8.3 (range,
11-31; median, 14) weeks (n=5). Delivery modes of remaining 31
(60.8%) pregnant patients were cesarean section in 19 (61.3%)[2,10,11,13,16,20,21,28-30,32,35,36,39,40,43,45,46], vaginal delivery in 6 (19.4%)[8,25,26,48,49],
forceps under epidural analgesia in 1 (3.2%)[33] and unknown in 5 (16.1%)
patients[14,17-19,34]. One (3.2%)
delivery timing was not given, 2 (6.5%) deliveries were in second trimester and 28
(90.3%) in third trimester with mean gestational age of 35.3±4.6 (range,
22-42; median, 37) weeks (n=30).

All the pregnant patients in the pregnancy termination group received a surgical
resection of the cardiac myxoma with an isolated cardiac myxoma resection in 5
(71.4%), myxoma resection with patch repair of the iatrogenic septal defect in 1
(14.3%) and myxoma resection with patent fossa ovalis closure in 1 (14.3%) patient.
One (14.3%) patient had pregnancy termination performed before cardiac surgery in 3
(42.9%), after the cardiac surgery in 2 (28.6%) and unknown surgical sequence in 2
(28.6%) patients. The indications for pregnancy termination was maternal pulmonary
edema in 1 (14.3%)[9], fetal growth retardation (fetal short femur) in 1
(14.3%)[50] and
unknown in 5 (71.4%) patients.

In the pregnancy termination group, 6 (85.7%) pregnant patients were event-free and 1
(14.3%) was complicated with postoperative transient acute myocardial
infarction[9].
The prognosis of the pregnant patient was not given in 2 patients[22]. In the remaining 42 pregnant
patients with a childbirth, 35 (83.3%) were event-free, 6 (14.3%) were complicated,
with cerebral involvement (psychomotor agitation and mydriasis
anisocoria)[40], heart block[30], pacing dependent rhythm[28], pulmonary
edema[32],
uterine contractions[26], and premature labor[34]), and 1 (2.4%) was recurrent (requiring
reoperation)[29]. No pregnant patients died. Pregnant patients' event free
survival (P=0.680), complication (P=0.686) and
recurrence rates (P=0.857) did not differ between pregnancy
termination and delivery groups.

Eighteen (42.9%) patients had a delivery before cardiac surgery[8,14,17,19,24,26-30,33,34,38,40,46,47,49], in the first, second, third and unknown
trimester in 2 (11.1%), 8 (44.4%), 6 (33.3%) and 2 (11.1%) patients with a mean
gestational age of 21.6±6.2 (range, 10-28.1; median, 23) weeks
(n=16). Thirteen (31.0%) patients has cardiac myxoma resection
performed after delivery in second, third and unknown trimester in 1 (7.7%), 9
(69.2%), and 3 (23.1%) patients at a mean gestational age of 34.2±5.5 (range,
22.2-41; median, 32.7) weeks (n=10)[11,13,16,18,20,21,29,32,35,36,39,41,43]. Two (4.8%)
patients received a one-stage delivery and cardiac surgical procedure in the
31st and 32.7th week, respectively. Surgical sequence was
unknown in 9 (21.4%) patients.

In the delivery group, delivery mode was not given in 16 cases. Among the 26
deliveries with either cesarean section or vaginal delivery, 20 (76.9%) were
event-free survivals, 4 (15.4%) were complicated and 2 (7.7%) died. Neonatal
prognoses did not differ between delivery modes, treatment options, timing of cardiac
surgery and sequence of cardiac myxoma in relation to delivery (Tables 4-7).

Nomimal regression analysis showed that timing of delivery, delivery mode, surgical
resection of the cardiac myxoma, simple or complex cardiac surgery, timing of cardiac
surgery, sequence of cardiac surgery in relation to delivery and maternal
complications were not predictive risk factors responsible for fetal outcomes.

Cardiac myxoma is rare in pregnant patients. The diagnosis and management can be
challenging in terms of the nature of the intracardiac mass, timing of delivery,
necessity of cardiac surgery and risks of subsequent treatment[36]. The clinical manifestations of
a cardiac myxoma can be one or more of the Goodwin's triad[51]. Patients may present with
fatigue and dyspnea, which, however, can be misinterpreted as asthma or normal fatigue
associated with pregnancy[39]. Echocardiography remains the standard non-invasive
diagnostic modality, particularly in the pregnant patient[52]. In some patients, atrial
thrombi may have a stalk and may be mistaken for myxomas, leading to unnecessary and
potential harmful surgery[53]. A left intraatrial mass can be diagnosed as thrombus if
associated with atrial fibrillation, dilated left atrium, mitral or tricuspid stenosis,
low ejection fraction, prosthetic mitral or tricuspid valves, or spontaneous atrial
contrast echoes[54].
Moreover, in the pregnant patients, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is
indicated for visualizing coarctation, aortitis, aortic dissection and atrial
myxoma[52].

Surgical management of cardiac myxoma is similar to that of the valvular disorders in
the pregnant patients, even with minimally invasive cardiac surgical
techniques[55].
Nevertheless, surgical indications of both conditions can be somehow different from each
other. Congestive heart failure as a consequence of rheumatic mitral stenosis is always
a contraindication of pregnancy. But it may be curable to percutaneous inteventional
therapy, however, carrying the risk of fetal teratogenicity by manipulation under X-ray.
Or else, an urgent valvular operation is warranted in the presence of infective
endocarditis, intramural thrombus, paravalvular leakage, stuck prosthetic valve or
thrombus formation. Meanwhile, the indications for cardiac myxoma resection are the
potential embolic events and sudden death caused by myxoma-obstructed valve
orifice[2]. Wang
et al.[2] reported three
pregnant patients with a cardiac myxoma, two of which were complicated with cerebral
infarctions and an urgent cardiac myxoma resection with later curettage was performed.
Liu et al.[6] described
a pregnant patient with a cardiac myxoma presented with both cerebral infarction and
central retinal artery occlusion, and a cardiac surgical resection was performed without
delay. As for the potential of cardiogenic embolic events and possible preterm delivery
due to hemodynamic changes, a timely surgical resection of cardiac myxoma can be
indispensable during pregnancy.

The favorable maternal and fetal outcomes suggest that there might be a subset of
pregnant patients with intracardiac masses who may benefit from non-surgical
management[36].
Open heart surgery as well as the use of cardiopulmonary bypass may cause premature
labor and endanger the baby[49]. The surgical resection of cardiac myxoma may be associated
with a 30% baby loss rate, or postnatal physical or developmental
disabilities[39].
It is encouraging that maternal survival rate was 100% in the pregnant patients with a
cardiac myxoma, superior to that of the pregnant patients with infective
endocarditis[3].
This might be interpreted as the results of the advantaged cardiopulmonary bypass
techniques including high flow rate, high perfusion pressure and pulsatile flow applied
in cardiac surgery during pregnancy[30]. By comparison, infective endocarditis and acute aortic
dissection might be more dangerous to the pregnant patients than cardiac myxoma as for
the infective nature of the former and the use of profound hypothermic circulatory
arrest for the operation of the latter[3,56]. The present
study also revealed that timing of delivery other than the delivery mode (by excluding
early termination of pregnancy) and time sequence of cardiac surgery and delivery was
closely related to feto-neonatal mortality. Cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass
should be avoided in the first trimester, particularly after six weeks, due to the risk
of teratogenesis[50].
The pregnant patients may wait for a few weeks[13], or take weekly thyrotropin-releasing hormone
and ß-methasone therapies for fetal lung maturation[35]. Precautions during cardiac
operation include using blood priming solution, normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and
high perfusion pressure[38].

Possible bias may be generated in present patient setting due to limited data available
from the literature for the statistical analysis. Therefore, more abundant information
of such patients is necessary for further precise results.

Cardiac myxoma is rare in pregnant patients. In most cases, the cardiac myxoma is
diagnosed in the second trimester and is resected in the third. Cesarean section was the
most frequent delivery mode. The 100% maternal survival of this patient setting is
encouraging. A delivery at early gestation was closely related to an increased
feto-neonatal mortality. A delivery postponed to late pregnancy until fetal maturity may
improve the feto-neonatal survival. In brief, embolic potential and hemodynamic
deterioration are indications for an urgent cardiac myxoma resection. Otherwise, cardiac
surgery should be avoided in the first trimester and be postponed until fetal pulmonary
maturation or after delivery.

Mycobacterial endocarditis: a comprehensive review. by Yuan SM
A systematic analysis was made in view of the epidemiology, clinical
features, diagnosis, treatment and main outcomes of mycobacterial
endocarditis.

The data source of the present study was based on a comprehensive literature
search in MEDLINE, Highwire Press and Google search engine for publications
on mycobacterial endocarditis published between 2000 and 2013.

The rapidly growing mycobacteria become the predominant pathogens with
Mycobacterium chelonae being the most common. This condition has changed
significantly in terms of epidemiology since the 21st century,
with more broad patient age range, longer latency, prevailed mitral valve
infections and better prognosis.

Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare and the causative pathogens are
predominantly the rapidly growing mycobacteria. Amikacin, ciprofloxacin and
clarithromycin are the most frequently used targeted antimicrobial agents
but often show poor responses. Patients with deep infections may warrant a
surgical operation or line withdrawal. With periodic multidrug therapy
guided by drug susceptibility testing, and surgical managements, patients
may achieve good therapeutic results.

Uma análise sistemática foi feita considerando epidemiologia, quadro clínico,
diagnóstico, tratamento e principais resultados da endocardite
micobacteriana.

Foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica abrangente no MEDLINE, Highwire
Press e no Google para publicações sobre endocardite micobacteriana,
publicados entre 2000 e 2013.

As micobactérias de crescimento rápido tornam-se os patógenos predominantes,
com Mycobacterium chelonae sendo a mais comum. Essa
condição se alterou significativamente em termos de epidemiologia, desde o
início do século 21, abrangendo faixa etária mais ampla, maior latência,
prevalecendo infecções da valva mitral e melhor prognóstico.

Endocardite micobacteriana é rara e os patógenos causadores são
predominantemente as micobactérias de crescimento rápido. Amicacina,
ciprofloxacina e claritromicina são os agentes antimicrobianos mais
frequentemente utilizados, mas muitas vezes apresentam respostas pobres.
Pacientes com infecções profundas podem justificar um procedimento cirúrgico
ou retirada de linha. Com a poliquimioterapia periódica guiada por testes de
sensibilidade às drogas, e abordagens cirúrgicas, os pacientes podem obter
bons resultados terapêuticos.

Cardiac disorders, pregnancy and other surgical maneuvers can be risk factors of
bacterial infective endocarditis[1-4].
Increasingly utilization of foreign medical materials, indwelling catheter
insertions and intravenous drug uses are recognized risk factors predisposing to
bacterial infective endocarditis of the present era[5]. Continuous changes in terms of epidemiology and
management strategies of the bacterial infective endocarditis have been
elucidated[5].
Staphylococcus aureus has become the most common microorganism
of the bacterial infective endocarditis particularly associated with increasing
foreign material implant[6], while Streptococcus viridans infections
reduced[5].
However, there is no updated elaboration on recent changes of mycobacterial
endocarditis.

Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare. It showed a significant predilection of
non-tuberculous over tuberculous mycobacteria in terms of infective endocarditis.
Due to more resistant to antimicrobial therapies than other pathogens, mycobacteria
are often refractory to antimicrobial treatments and are associated with a very high
mortalit[7].
Rapid-growth non-tuberculous mycobacteria including Mycobacterium (M.) chelonae, M.
abscessus and M. fortuitum accounted for 68% of the isolates[8] and thus being the predominant
mycobacteria for the infections. There have been systemic reviews on infective
endocarditis caused by M. fortuitum[7,9] in
2002, and by M. abscessus[10] and M. chelonae[11] in recent years. Due to the rarity, regular
management strategies are still scanty. As for the difficulty of pathogen
identifications, poor responses to antimicrobial therapy and poor prognosis, this
condition remains a challenge with regard to diagnosis and treatment. However,
mycobacterial endocarditis has not been sufficiently elaborated. The present study
is designed to highlight the clinical pictures of mycobacterial endocarditis based
on relevant literature information published since 2000.

MEDLINE, Highwire Press and Google search engine were searched for publications in
the English language on mycobacterial endocarditis from 2000 to 2013. The terms
"mycobacteria", "heart valve", "heart valve prosthesis", "tuberculous",
"non-tuberculous" and "endocarditis" were used for the searches. All the articles,
titles and subject headings were screened carefully for potential relevance.
Articles were included if the patient had an established diagnosis of mycobacteria
endocarditis on current admission and outcome data were reported.

Due to the rarity of the condition, all the discovered articles reported only
sporadic single or small series; no large population, comparative studies were
retrievable. Therefore, data from this systematic review were qualitatively analyzed
as suggested in the Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses recommendations.

The search identified 31 relevant studies from 2000 to 2013[7,9-38],
including 24 case reports[7,9,10,12,13,15,17-22,24-28,30-33,36-38], 2
case series[14,23], 2 original
articles[11,34], 1 medical
imaging[16], 1
poster abstract session[29], and 1 "letter to the editor"[35]. After reviewing selected
articles, all 31 articles were included and no one was excluded. Data were extracted
from the text, figures, or tables and included details of the study population,
demographics, types of mycobacteria, sites of infections, locations of vegetations,
latency, sensitivity, antimicrobial spectrum, management strategies, clearance time,
follow-up length and main outcomes (survivals, complications, relapses,
reinterventions and mortality).

Quantitative data were presented as mean±standard deviation, and intergroup
differences were compared by unpaired t-test. Comparisons of frequencies were
performed by Fisher's exact test. P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

The patient setting included 50 patients with mycobacterial endocarditis. There
were 29 males and 21 females with a male-to-female ration of 1.38:1. Their ages
were 45.9±19.8 (range, 0.5-78; median 50) years (n=50). Age distribution of the
patients conformed to the normal distribution by probability-probability
plot.

The major symptoms on admission were described in 46 patients including fever in
35 (76.1%)[7,9-29,33,37,38],
dyspnea in 10 (21.7%)[10,11,31,32]
and chest pain in 1 (2.1%) patient[30] (χ 2=60.7, P=0.000). The
duration of the symptoms was 4.0±4.4 (range, 0.17-18; median, 2) months (n=31).
The temperature of the febrile patients were 38.9±0.8℃ (n=12). Of the febrile
patients, fever grade was not indicated in 22[11,14,18,23,24,26,28,29,33,35,36,38].
In the remaining 13 patients, 5 (38.5%) had a high fever[12,17,19,20,22,29],
5 (38.5%) had a moderate fever[13,15,21,25,34]
and 3 (23.1%) had a low-grade fever[9,27,37]
(χ 2=0.9, P=0.630). Of them, 4 were prolonged
fever[24,35,36] and 2 were fever of unknown
origin[14,16].

The cardiac murmur was mentioned in 15 patients: a cardiac murmur in 12 (80%) (a
pansystolic murmur at the apex in 5[14,21,27,30,38],
a diastolic murmur in the aortic region in 2[13,18], a systolic murmur in the aortic
region[36], a
pansystolic murmur at the apex + a diastolic murmur in the aortic
region[25], a
pansystolic murmur at the apex + a systolic murmur in the aortic
region[15], a
systolic murmur at the lower left sternal boarder[37] and an unspecified cardiac
murmur[32] in 1
patient each) and an absence of a cardiac murmur in 3 (20%)
patients[20,22,24]
(χ 2=10.8, P=0.001).

Laboratory examinations revealed their hemoglobin was 9.9±1.8 (range, 5.9-12.5;
median, 10) g/L (n=10)[9,10,12,13,15,18,20,27,30,36,38],
white blood cell count was 8.9±4.4 (range, 3.3-16.8; median, 8.2)
×109/L (n=13)[9,10,13,15,20-22,24,27,28,30,33,38],
platelet count was 165.6±128.7 (range, 67-450; median, 124)×109/L
(n=7)[10,13,15,18,20,27,38],
C-reaction protein was 6.8±4.7 (range, 0.14-11; median, 8) mg/dL
(n=4)[10,20,27,28], and CD4 was 240.5 ± 206.3 (range, 44-587; median
196)/mm3 (n=6)[9,10,13,14,19,37].
CD4 was normal (>500/mm3) in 1 (16.7%) patient, and was abnormal
(<500/mm3) in 5 (83.3%) patients (χ 2=5.3,
P=0.021).

Cardiac surgery, foreign material implant, intravenous drug use and miscellaneous
risk factors were the underlying etiologies for the development of infective
endocarditis (χ 2=31.9, P=0.000) (Table 1). Of the causative cardiac
operations, 23 (85.2%) were heart valve operations and 4 (14.8%) were congenital
atrial/ventricular defect patch repairs (χ 2=26.7,
P=0.000). There were 22 (95.7%) valve replacements and 1 (4.3%)
valve repair (χ 2 = 38.4, P=0.000). Eighteen (81.8%)
were single valve replacements, and 4 (18.2%) were double valve replacements (χ
2=17.8, P=0.000); and 17 (77.3%) were first time
valve replacements and 5 (22.7%) were redo operations (χ 2=13.1,
P=0.001). A total of 26 valves were replaced including 13
(50%) aortic and 13 (50%) mitral valve replacements; 20 (80%) were biological,
and 5 (20%) were mechanical valve prostheses (χ 2 = 18,
P=0.000), except the one whose detail of aortic valve
prosthesis was not given.

The latency from the presence of the predisposing risk factors to symptom onset
was 21.9±25.9 (range, 0.067-96; median, 12) months (n=31)[7,9,11,12,14-18,20,21,23,26,27,31-33,37].
There were 9 (29.0%) early onsets (latency <8 weeks), 2 (6.5%) intermediate
onsets (latency was between 8 weeks and 8 months) and 20 (64.5%) late onsets
(latency >8 months) (χ 2=23.9, P=0.000). The
latency of the patients with cardiac operations was much shorter than that of
the patients with a foreign material implant, but did not reach a statistical
significance (16.4±20.1 months vs. 34.8±39.0 months, P=0.136).
It was incompatible with intravenous drug use patients, of which latency was
reported in only one patient, and was much shorter than that of the
miscellaneity reaching a quasi-statistical difference (16.4±20.1 months vs.
44±34.6 months, P=0.051) (Figure
1). Bioprosthetic valve endocarditis was associated with a longer
latency than mechanical without showing a significant difference (17.5±22.5
months vs. 10.8±7.1 months, P=0.569). Four patients had a
delayed diagnosis for 0.81±0.24 (range, 0.5-1; median, 0.88) months
(n=4)[12,13,20,26].

The infection sites could be divided into 5 types according the location and
number of the mycobacterial infections: single intracardiac infection in 38
(76%), two intracardiac infections in 9 (18%), and triple valve infections,
single intracardiac + single extracardiac infections, and double intracardiac +
single extracardiac infections in 1 (2%) patient, each (χ 2=128.5,
P=0.000). Including extracardiac infections associated with
the endocarditis, totally 64 sites were affected with a mean of 1.28±0.54
(range, 1-3; median, 1) infection sites per patient. There were 1.24±0.48
infection sites in the non-tuberculous and 1.75±0.96 infection sites in the
tuberculous endocarditis patients (P=0.067). Native aortic,
mitral and tricuspid valves were the most commonly affected sites of
mycobacterial endocarditis, representing 29.7%, 26.6% and 10.9%, respectively
(Figure 2). No difference was found in
the prevalence of infection sites between non-tuberculous and tuberculous
mycobacterial endocarditis (Table 2), or
in the strain distributions between aortic and mitral valves (Table 3).

Vegetations were detected in 44 patients with 43 detected by echocardiography and
1 patient detected by positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
uptake[16]. Of
them, 12 (27.3%) patients did not have a visualized vegetation[7,9,11,14,17,28,31],
but one of them with an abscess along the inferior and septal walls,
instead[31] and
32 (72.7%) patients had (χ 2=18.2, P=0.000). The
vegetation locations of the remaining 32 patients were mitral valve in 10
(31.3%)[11,20,21,30,36,37]
(two of them were in the prosthetic mitral valve)[20,1], aortic valve in 7 (21.9%)[11,13,18,32,33,38]
(one was in the prosthetic aortic valve)[33], pacemaker lead in 3
(12.5%)[16,26,27],
tricuspid valve in 3 (9.4%)[10,19,35],
both mitral valve and right subclavian catheter in 1 (3.1%)[36], both mitral and aortic
valves in 2 (6.3%)[12,15],
both aortic and tricuspid valves in 2 (6.3%)[22,24], mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves in 1
(3.1%)[25],
tricuspid valve and ventricular septal defect patch in 2 (6.3%)[35] and atrial septal patch in 1
(3.1%) patient[23],
respectively. The detection time for a positive vegetation was described in 3
patients, which was 5[13], 21[20] and 105 days[15] after admission, respectively. Dimensions of
the vegetations were recorded in 16 patients for 17 vegetations. Five
vegetations of 5 patients from a single report[11] were recorded as "minimal", which were
excluded from the calculation of the vegetation size. The size of the remaining
12 vegetations of 11 patients was 19.7±18.4 (range, 5-70; median, 15.5)
mm[10,15,18,20,23-26,30,32,37].
Valve insufficiency was present in 23 (46%) patients: mitral valve regurgitation
in 9 (39.1%)[11,30,31,37]
(6 were prosthetic mitral valve leaks[11]), aortic valve regurgitation in 5
(21.7%)[11,28,32]
(4 were prosthetic aortic valve leaks[11,32]), aortic and mitral valve regurgitation in 5
(21.7%)[11,12,14,38]
(2 were prosthetic aortic and mitral valve leaks[11]) and tricuspid valve
regurgitation in 4 (17.4%) patients[10,27,35].
There were totally 11 (47.8%) native valve regurgitations and 12 (52.2%)
prosthetic valve leaks (χ 2=0.1, P=0.768). Besides,
one patient had inferior and septal wall abscess associated with mitral valve
regurgitation[31] and one patient had ventricular septal patch
dehiscence[35].

The initial blood culture results were not indicated in 5
patients[29,34].
In the remaining 45 patients, a negative culture prevailed, followed by an
acid-fast bacterium (Table 4).

Thirty-seven patients had more investigations performed for strain
identifications. Fourteen patients had more samples than blood for cultures: 7
(50%) patients had one more sample, 4 (28.6%) patients had 2 more samples, 2
(14.3%) patients had 3 more samples and 1 (7.1%) patient had 4 more samples for
cultures, respectively. There were totally 25 additional samples for cultures
including 4 (16%) intraoperative excised valves[12,18], or valve prosthesis[7], or prosthetic valve ring[14], 4 (16%) resected
vegetations[27,30,35],
3 (12%) sputum[27,28,34],
2 (8%) bronchoalveolar lavage[14,27],
2 (8%) urine[14,27],
2 (8%) bone marrow[14,37],
1 (4%) removed patch[35], removed pacing lead[26], intraoperative specimens (with no details
available)[34],
pacemaker generator pocket site[26], aspirated fluid[26], sternum[7], cerebrospinal fluid[37] and tracheal
swab[15] for
each, respectively. Lowenstein-Jensen medium was once used for valve, sternum
and blood cultures[7]. Three (12%) were negative and 22 (88%) were positive
(χ 2=28.8, P=0.000). The 22 positive cultures
identified the strains to be M. fortuitum in 7 (31.8%),
M. chimaera in 4 (18.2%), M. abscessus in
3 (13.6%), M. chelonae in 2 (9.1%), M. neoaurum
in 1 (4.5%), acid-fast bacilli in 2 (9.1%), rapidly growing
mycobacteria in 1 (4.5%) and tubercule bacilli in 2 (9.1%), respectively. At
least 15 (68.2%) cases were rapid growing mycobacteria infections.

Seventeen patients (four of them had additional samples for cultures) had a
positive histological staining results by Ziehl-Neelsen and auramine-rhodamine
stains[12,17,18,27] with acid-fast organisms shown on fluorescence
microscopy.

Initial blood culture results

Ten patients had a molecular analysis of the mycobacteria, where 16s ribosomal
deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing was applied in 4 (40%)[14,20,21,23],
reverse line blot hybridization in 4 (40%)[29] and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism analysis in 2 (20%) patients [10,33], respectively. All patients had fresh
samples, and one of them had additional cryopreserved samples for
investigations. However, analyses on the cryopreserved samples disclosed
negative results, while all fresh specimens displayed positive results. In
addition, two patients had mycolic acid analysis by biochemical and
chromatographic techniques[7,9].

By preliminary blood cultures, histological staining, molecular analyses and
chromatographic techniques, the eventual mycobacterial strains were identified
in all but one patient (Figure 3).
Distributions of the mycobacteria responding to the four predisposing risk
factors showed cardiac operation was associated with more, prevailed rapidly
growing mycobacteria (M. chelonae, M. fortuitum and M. chimaera) endocarditis,
foreign material implant was associated with M. fortuitum, and intravenous drug
use and miscellaneity were prone to be of tuberculous endocarditis (Figure 4, Table 5).

Pathogens corresponding to predisposing risk factors

According to the antimicrobial spectrum, intravenous amikacin 300 mg twice daily,
ciprofloxacin 400-500 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily were
the most frequently used targeted antimicrobial agents, and imipenem (500 mg/6
hours), linezolid, rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg
(p.o., thrice daily) were more frequently used for non-tuberculous mycobacterial
infection; while ethambutol (20 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (10 mg/kg/day),
pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg/day) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) were for tuberculous
mycobacterial infection. The antimycobacterial course was life in 2
patients[18,35].
In another 19 patients[10-13,22-24,26,28,33,34],
the treatment course was indicated, which was 2.7±2.3 (range, 0.83-9; median,
1.67) months. The clearance time interval was 31.8±58.4 (range, 2-210; median,
12.5) days (n=12)[12,13,15,19-21,23,34,35].

Patients were at a follow-up of 48.7±39.8 (range, 3-116; median, 32) months
(n=23)[9,11,17,19-21,23,26,30,32,34].
Totally 27 (50%) patients were event-free survivals[12,16,17,19,20,22-24,26,28,30,33-35],
3 (6.25%) patients relapsed at 0.5, 5 and 10 months,
respectivel[9,10,18],
4 (6.25%) patients were complicated[21,25,29,32]
and one of them required reintervention[32], which constituted the only reintervention
of the whole setting, and 17 (34%) patients died[11-15,18,27,29,31,36-38]
at 83.9±85.9 (range, 1-270; median, 64) days (n=11). The death causes were
described in 8 patients, which were multiorgan failure in 2[12,15], and candidaemia and hospital-acquired
pneumonia[36],
persistent mycobacteremia and stroke[29], progressive heart failure[14], respiratory
distress[37],
splenic rupture[14]
and variceal bleeding[31] in 1 patient, each.

Two patients did not receive either medical or surgical treatment, but had a good
prognosis in each. Of the remaining 48 patients, 32 (66.7%) patients received an
antimicrobial therapy alone, 10 (20.8%) patients had a cardiac operation and 6
(12.5%) patients had an intervention for removal of catheter/lead/defibrillator
( χ 2=36.8, P=0.000).

In the patients with medical treatment, there were 17 event-free
survivals[11,19,22,30,34,35],
11 deaths[11,13,14,29,31,37,38],
2 complicated (spleen infarct, renal infarct and cerebral abscess on day 10, and
prosthetic valve endocarditis due to coagulase negative staphylococcal species
at 1 year in one patient[21]; and periaortic abscess in another[29]) and 2
relapses[9,10].
In the surgical treatment group, all patients received a valve replacement
operation, including 2 aortic valve replacements (AVRs), 1 AVR with root
replacement, 1 redo-AVR, 1 2nd redo-AVR, 2 AVRs + mitral valve
replacements (MVRs), 1 AVR + MVR + tricuspid valvuloplasy, 1 2nd
redo-AVR + MVR and 1 redo-MVR. There were 5 event-free
survivals[12,17,20,28,33],
3 deaths[12,18,29], 2 complicated (1 preoperative stroke and 1
complication related with his previous ascending aortic
replacement)[25,32],
1 relapse[18] and 1
reintervention[32]. In the patients with a catheter/lead/defibrillator
removal, there were 3 event-free survivals[16,24,26]
and 3 deaths[15,27,36].
Time of deaths was described in 11 patients. There were 4 (36.4%) early deaths
and 7 (63.6%) late deaths (χ 2=1.6, P=0.201).

In 1959, Runyon[39],
according to pigment of colony and rate of growth, divided mycobacteria into 4
types: photochromogen, scotochromogen, nonphotochromogen and rapid grower. The
latter one, rapidly growing mycobacterium, was defined so because the mycobacterial
colonies form at 25-45&ºC on solid agar in 5-7 days. Both slowly and rapidly
growing mycobacteria are environmental opportunistic mycobacteria that are normal
inhabitants of natural waters, drinking water and soils[40]. The most important slowly
growing species are M. avium and M.
intracellulare, called the M. avium complex; and rapidly
growing mycobacteria (M. abscessus, M. chelonae and M.
fortuitum), which are opportunistic pathogens[40].

Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare. In a recent report of infective endocarditis
incorporating information from 13 tertiary hospitals in Turkey, no myocabacterial
endocarditis was reported[41]. Wallace et al.[42] stated that the incidence of mycobacterial
endocarditis was 33.3% (4/12) out of M. fortuitum or M.
chelonae bacteria and was 3.2% of rapid growth mycobacterial blood
infections. Olalla et al.[7] reviewed 19 cases of rapid growth mycobacterial
endocarditis and noted that patients' age was 45 (range, 20-74) years, including 4
native and 15 prosthetic valve endocarditis, with a biological valve prosthesis in 6
and a mechanical valve prosthesis in 9 patients.

The degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the
illness[43]. As it
was illustrated in the present article, no dominance of fever grade was associated
with mycobacterial endocarditis. Strabelli et al.[11] reported that the latent for the febrile onset
and development of valve dysfunction was few days and months to years, respectively.
In 5 of 13 patients with prosthetic mycobacterial endocarditis, the latent period
for the diagnosis of bioprosthetic endocarditis was 1-4 years[11]. Olalla et al.[7] reported a latency of 12 weeks
from infection to symptom onset with no difference found between biological and
mechanical prosthetic valve endocarditis. The present study revealed a more broad
patient age range from infant to 78 years old with a normal age distribution,
equality of affected aortic and mitral valves, more native than prosthetic valve and
more bioprosthetic than mechanical bioprosthetic endocarditis. Moreover, cardiac
operations caused a shorter latency to endocarditis occurrence than foreign material
implant and miscellaneous risk factors. Bioprosthetic valve endocarditis was
associated with a longer latency than mechanical but lack of a significant
difference. Kunin et al.[9] reported a prevailed early onset of mycobacterial
endocarditis. Valve dysfunction was noted in 10 (76.9%) patients, while only 3
(23.1%) patients were free of valve dysfunction (χ 2=12.5,
P=0.001). The present study demonstrated a predominant late
onset and a decreased incidence of valve dysfunction.

The most common predisposing risk factors for mycobacterial infections include
medical procedures (central venous access, hemodialysis catheter indwelling, various
surgical operations including mammoplasty, arthroplasty and cardiothoracic
operations)[9],
immunocompromised, particularly patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome, hematological malignancies, or those treated with
immunosuppressive drugs after solid organ transplantation[44]. More recently, the use of tumor
necrosis factor-αblockers has become an additional risk factor[45]. Line-related non-tuberculous
infections did not have any predominant organisms including M. abscessus, M.
chelonae, M. neoaurum, M. fortuitum and M.
mucogenicum[34]. Further, possible manufacturer contamination of
bioprosthesis by M. chelonea has been recognized[46]. In addition, nosocomial
infections were once evidenced from sources like cardioplegic
solutions[47],
water suppl[48],
antiseptic solutions[49] and valve prosthesis preservation
solutions[50].

Positivity of blood cultures varied according to types of affected valves. It was 75%
in mechanical, 20% in biological and 100% in native valves[7]. Removed valve prostheses showed
a high positivity of mycobacterial cultures[48]. Upon colonial growth, gram and acid-fast stains
should be performed, and then when blood cultures are negative, acid-fast bacilli
stains on histological examination of the removed prosthetic valves[11] and Ziehl-Neelsen stain should
be employed, followed by subcultures[40].

Mycobacteria are more resistant to chemical disinfection than other
pathogens[11].
Infective endocarditis caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria is always refractory
due to extensive drug resistance and substantially delayed
diagnosis[36]. The
poor response to therapy can be a result of various factors that may lead to drug
resistance, including the presence of biofilms, type of antimicrobial agent used and
presence of a novel inducible erm(41) gene[51]. With periodic multidrug therapy guided by drug
susceptibility testing, patients may achieve good therapeutic
results[51].
Therefore, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the isolates are of important
clinical significance[36]. The management of rapidly growing mycobacteria is
usually an empiric therapy with two agents and a successive targeted regimen
according to drug sensitivity tests[9]. Amikacin was the most reliable agent for the treatment of
non-tuberculous mycobacteria and alternative effective agents included
ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, imipenem and linezolid[34]. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria
are more sensitive to some antibiotics than other rapidly growing
mycobacteria[32].
Clarithromycin was proved to be sensitive to M. abscessus/chelonae. Moxifloxacin was
discovered to be the best to treat M. fortuitum infections, very active against M.
chelonae when used alone and more effective against all the strains when combined
with clarithromycin and amikacin[52]. A combined use of clarithromycin with moxifloxacin or
linezolid at a high concentration (16 µg/ml) also displayed activity against M.
abscessus[51].
Disseminated infections with atypical mycobacteria often develop in
immunocompromised patients with reduced CD4 count and complement
levels[37]. A
combined antimicrobial therapy with prolonged treatment duration is often the
regimen of choice. Amikacin and imipenem have been proved to be effective agents for
the disseminated cases[32].

Patients with deep infections of rapidly growing mycobacteria often warrant a
surgical intervention including line removal, debridement, or removal of the foreign
material[34]. An
improved survival was advocated to be associated with surgical
interventions[33],
whereas some patients with conservative managements failed to
survive[13]. In the
patient series of Olalla et al.[7] reported in 2002, 15 of 19 cases of M.
fortuitum complex (M. fortuitum and M.
chelonae) endocarditis were prosthetic valve endocarditis and valve
replacement was performed in 8 (42.1%) patients with an overall mortality of 88%.
Recently, Strabelli et al.[11] reported 13 patients with M. chelonae
endocarditis received a valve replacement and an overall mortality was decreased to
23.1% (3/13) including 1 (7.7%) early and 2 (15.4%) late deaths. Exceptionally, a
few patients did not receive any antimicrobial treatment and patients were at
long-term event-free survival[11]. These results implied that foreign material implant
becomes an apparent risk factor for infective endocarditis, and usage of higher dose
and combined antimicrobial regimens with reference to the mycobacterial species and
surgical treatment can lead to improved outcomes.

The rarity of this condition as well as the relevant published materials made this
study a limited patient population. Abundant valuable date in the future may
replenish the research with more accurate results.

Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare but dreadful. The rapidly growing mycobacteria
become the predominant pathogens with chelonae being the most
common. This condition has changed significantly in terms of epidemiology since the
21st century, with more broad patient age range, longer latency,
prevailed mitral valve infections and better prognosis. The better prognoses than
before might be attributed to the faster strain identification molecular techniques,
higher dose of antimicrobial agents, periodic multidrug therapy guided by drug
susceptibility testing and more requirements of surgical interventions.
